                            <p>The Facility offers various Challenges in which Users can participate by paying an entry fee via an SCA Card, as described in greater detail below. The entry fee for each Challenge will be posted by the Facility at each Challenge. Users who successfully complete a Challenge may win a cash prize, as determined by the Facility and posted at the Challenge, which will be separately accounted for on the User’s SCA Card. The Facility reserves the right to change the entry fee for entering a Challenge and/or the prize for successfully completing a challenge at any time. Users must comply with all rules and requirements associated with each Challenge, including any age restrictions, skill level requirements, or other eligibility criteria. The rules for each Challenge will be posted at the Challenge or otherwise made available by the Facility’s Guest Services. The Facility reserves the right to disqualify any User who violates these rules or requirements or engages in any unsportsmanlike, disruptive, cheating, or fraudulent conduct related to a Challenge. If a Challenge malfunctions or otherwise becomes inoperable during a User’s attempt at the Challenge, the User will be allowed one free attempt at the same Challenge, or if that Challenge cannot be quickly put back into service, the User may opt for a refund of the entry fee paid for the Challenge.
                            </p>
                            <h5>a.	SCA Card Issuance and Usage.</h5>
                            
                            <p>Users may be issued an SCA Card, either physical or virtual, to access and participate in Challenges. SCA Cards must be registered to the User's Account and may only be used by the registered User. SCA Cards may be loaded with funds with a credit card, debit card, or cash, in the Facility’s discretion, which can be used to enter Challenges. There is no fee to obtain an SCA Card, to initially load funds onto an SCA Card, or to load additional funds onto an SCA Card. Participating in a Challenge will reduce the User’s SCA Card balance by the entry fee for such Challenge. The SCA Card is only valid at the Facility, and is not valid at any other “Sports Challenge America” location other than the Facility. SCA Cards may not be resold or otherwise transferred, and any SCA Card so resold or transferred will be void and subject to cancellation.  The Facility reserves the right to refuse to accept an SCA Card or otherwise to limit use of an SCA Card if it believes the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful or violates these Terms & Conditions. If a User is unable to access their SCA Card, whether by loss or theft of a physical SCA Card or device storing a virtual SCA Card, forgetting login credentials to the Website or Account, or otherwise, the Facility will attempt in good faith to verify the User’s identity and restore access to the User’s SCA Card, but shall not be liable to the User if it is unable to restore the User’s access their SCA Card.

                            <p>Prizes for successfully completing Challenges will be separately accounted for on the User’s SCA Card and can be redeemed by the User. The Facility may require Users to provide additional information or documentation to verify their identity and eligibility to receive Challenge prizes. Users are responsible for any taxes or other charges associated with receiving Challenge prizes. The Facility will report payout of Challenge prizes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with tax law and Users may receive a Form 1099 or other applicable tax form from the Facility. Users may be required to provide a valid social security number or tax identification number as a condition to the Facility paying any Challenge prize, if requested by the Facility.

                            <p>“SCA Card Balances” include funds loaded on the SCA Card by the User and any Challenge prizes won by the User. SCA Card Balances do not expire and may be redeemed for cash, in whole or in part, by the User by visiting the Facility’s Guest Services during operating hours. There is no fee to redeem SCA Card Balances for cash and any such redemption shall reduce the User’s SCA Card Balance accordingly.

                            <p>Users may obtain a history of their SCA Card transactions by viewing their Account on the Website or SCA’s mobile application, or by inquiring at the Facility’s Guest Services. The Facility reserves the right to correct the balance of any User’s SCA Card if the Facility believes an error has occurred. A User may dispute any transaction or correction that has been assessed against their SCA Card by contacting the Facility’s Guest Services. The Facility will conduct an investigation and communicate the results within a reasonable time. The Facility shall have no liability for any error related to an SCA Card balance unless the User provides notice within 60 days of the date of the transaction in question.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Facility may suspend or terminate a User’s SCA Card and revoke or limit any or all of the rights and privileges granted to such User at any time without notice, liability, reimbursement, or compensation (i) due to a User’s fraudulent or unauthorized use of an SCA Card or any violation of these Terms & Conditions (“For Cause”); or (ii) for any other reason in the Facility’s discretion (“Without Cause”). If the Facility terminates a User’s SCA Card For Cause, the User’s SCA Card Balance will be voided and the User will receive no compensation from the Facility for the voided funds, subject to any applicable laws or regulations. If the Facility terminates a User’s SCA Card Without Cause, the Facility will refund the User’s current SCA Card Balance, less any amounts that the User may owe the Facility, upon the User’s request.

Assumption of Risk: I understand that entering a facility owned or operated by SCA and/or participating in any of the offerings provided by SCA, including but not limited to Challenges, Tournaments, Rentals, or any other sports activity or ancillary offering (the "Activities") involves inherent and significant risks, including, but not limited to, equipment malfunction, falls, collisions, being hit by a ball, club, or other objects, sliding injuries, overuse injuries, strains and sprains, cuts and abrasions, finger and hand injuries, sunburn, dehydration, heat-related illnesses, as well as the potential for severe bodily injury, disfigurement, paralysis, or even death.

Additional risks may include contracting a viral or bacterial infection, such as COVID-19, environmental hazards, such as uneven or slippery surfaces, poor weather conditions, and the actions or inactions of other participants. The Activities may also involve risks related to the use of facilities or equipment, including potential mechanical failures. Other accidents or injuries may result from my actions or the actions of others, including those that may be severe, permanent, disabling, or life-altering. I acknowledge that I am voluntarily participating in the Activities, and I assume all risks, both known and unknown, foreseeable and unforeseeable, associated with my participation.
